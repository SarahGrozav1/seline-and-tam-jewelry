### Early Development

At the start of the project, even though I had the wireframes as versions of how I wanted the site to look, I more often than not made early mockup versions of the pages to quickly get the framework of the pages set up and to test whether I might like to do something another way or differently from the wireframes. 

Here is an early example of my index page, mocked up at the very start of the project. 
Key differences here include two more sections about more informations about the jewelry store that I decided to dont include them anymore in my project so that I could focus more on backend. But I want to create them in the future.

I started the project with the home page and nav bar, before installing django allauth and getting the base templates for that. From there, I began working on backend more and didn't focuse on frontend because I wanted to leave it the last, first to make my project work and then add design and fronted details to look better.

Here is an early mockup of my collections page which I decided to don't make it anymore because I did a dropdown button in the navbar from where the user can select easily the collection he wants to see.
